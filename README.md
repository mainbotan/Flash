# Flash
The main task of Flash is to save your time through the use of flash classes.

Flash classes will allow you to remove repetitive styles from your project that apply to several elements at once. 
For example, you have several elements using the same text color, the same font style, but different text sizes. 
What to do?

Most likely, you will create several CSS classes and add the necessary styles to the created elements.
Flash tells you to stop, you don't have to do that. Why do you need to have duplicate styles? Let's just create a text-face, text-color class and finally two different text-size classes.

This is the basic concept of Flash. Use ready-made classes for quick design of elements.
